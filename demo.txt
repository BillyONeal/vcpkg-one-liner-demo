Speech about how experimental this is :)
iex (iwr -useb https://aka.ms/vcpkg-init.ps1)
vcpkg  (show that it works)
(open new window, show that vcpkg cmake ninja all don't work)
robocopy D:\ C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\demo
. ~/.vcpkg/vcpkg-init.ps1
vcpkg use cmake ninja
cmake -G Ninja "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$env:VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -S . -B ..\build
ninja -C ..\build
..\build\main.exe

Future:
Bugs bugs bugs
Usability testing
Command line options to edit the project e.g. vcpkg add port zlib
Getting the C++ compilers in here so you don't need full VS installed first

Bugs:
npm spew
vcpkg add artifact doesn't see vcpkg.json
. ~/.vcpkg/vcpkg-init runs the .cmd
cmake version for vcpkg and artifacts don't agree
